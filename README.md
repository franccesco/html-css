This is the first challange of a series of challanges to tests the different skills a web developer has or is able to produce  

The first one consist of making the student C.V in HTML and CSS without any boilerplate or library or framework.  

The student must do his C.V in HTML **exactly the same** as the one that he has in PDF using the best practices in HTML and CSS
